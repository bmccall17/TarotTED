## v1.2.1 - Zero-Cost Image Delivery + Social Sharing 🖼️
**Release Date:** January 5, 2026
**Status:** Production Ready

### Overview

Eliminates Vercel Image Optimization costs while maintaining excellent UX. Disables the `/_next/image` pipeline entirely and adds manual lazy loading + proper `sizes` attributes to all Image components. Also adds full social sharing support with Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags.

### ✨ Changes

#### **Cost Elimination**
- Set `unoptimized: true` in `next.config.ts` to disable Vercel Image Optimization
- **Result:** $0 image cache writes, no risk of billing overages

#### **UX Preservation**
- Added `loading="lazy"` to all below-fold Image components
- Added proper `sizes` attributes to thumbnails missing them
- Hero images retain `priority` for above-fold performance

#### **Social Sharing**
- Full Open Graph meta tags (title, description, image, site name)
- Twitter Card support with `summary_large_image` card type
- Uses `/applicationhero.png` as share preview image
- Works on Facebook, Discord, Twitter/X, LinkedIn
