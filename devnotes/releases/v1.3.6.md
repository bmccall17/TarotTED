# v1.3.6 - Signal Deck MVP 📡

**Released:** January 30, 2026

## Summary

Signal Deck is a social ops cockpit for tracking TarotTALKS social media shares. Think "SHIP LOG, but for social." Log posts in under 15 seconds, filter and search your share history, and watch your social presence grow.

## Features

### Core Tracking
- **New Share Form**: Log a post in under 15 seconds
  - Platform selector (X, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, Other)
  - Post URL with auto-resolution of shared TarotTALKS links
  - Auto-detects card/talk from pasted URLs (e.g., `tarottalks.app/cards/the-tower`)
  - Status tracking: Draft → Posted → Verified
  - Speaker handle capture for relationship tracking
  - Notes field for context

### Dashboard View
- **Stats Bar**: Today / This Week / Total share counts
- **Chronological Groups**: Today, Yesterday, This Week, Earlier
- **Share Rows**: Platform icon, title, status badge, external link

### Filters & Search
- Full-text search across notes and URLs
- Platform filter (X, Bluesky, Threads, LinkedIn, Other)
- Status filter (Draft, Posted, Verified)
- Date range picker

### URL Auto-Resolution
- Paste any TarotTALKS URL and it auto-detects:
  - Card pages → links to card record
  - Talk pages → links to talk record (with speaker name)
- API endpoint: `POST /api/admin/social-shares/resolve`

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
New `social_shares` table:
- `id` (UUID primary key)
- `platform` (enum: x, bluesky, threads, linkedin, other)
- `post_url` (the social platform URL)
- `status` (enum: draft, posted, verified)
- `posted_at` (timestamp)
- `shared_url` (the TarotTALKS URL being promoted)
- `card_id` / `talk_id` (foreign keys, nullable)
- `speaker_handle` / `speaker_name` (for relationship tracking)
- `notes` (freeform text)
- `created_at` / `updated_at`

### API Routes
- `GET /api/admin/social-shares` - List with filters + stats
- `POST /api/admin/social-shares` - Create new share
- `GET /api/admin/social-shares/[id]` - Get single share
- `PUT /api/admin/social-shares/[id]` - Update share
- `DELETE /api/admin/social-shares/[id]` - Delete share
- `POST /api/admin/social-shares/resolve` - Auto-resolve TarotTALKS URLs

### Components
- `app/admin/signal-deck/page.tsx` - Main page
- `components/admin/signal-deck/SharesList.tsx` - List with grouping
- `components/admin/signal-deck/ShareRow.tsx` - Individual share display
- `components/admin/signal-deck/ShareFilters.tsx` - Filter controls
- `components/admin/signal-deck/NewShareForm.tsx` - Create/edit modal

### Migration
- `lib/db/migrations/0005_social_shares.sql`

## Future Phases

- **Phase 2**: Performance metrics (likes, reposts, replies)
- **Phase 3**: Speaker relationship badges + follow hygiene
- **Phase 4**: Mention radar (discover organic sharing)
