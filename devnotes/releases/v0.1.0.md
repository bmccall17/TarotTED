**Data Quality:**
- 4 talks with duplicate YouTube video IDs
- 2 talks missing YouTube metadata (Caroline Casey, Steve Jobs)
- 11 talks with YouTube URLs in `tedUrl` field (should be TED.com URLs)

- 2 cards without primary mappings

**Infrastructure:**
- No admin interface (all content managed via database scripts)
- No validation dashboard for data quality issues
- No authentication or access control

### What's Next

**v0.2.0 - Admin Portal & Data Quality** (Q1 2025)
- Admin portal at `/admin` with token-based authentication
- Add/edit/delete talks and mappings through UI
- Metadata fetching from TED.com oEmbed and YouTube Data APIs
- Validation dashboard with guided fixes for all data issues
- Soft delete for talks, database constraints for integrity
