# v1.3.5 - Talk Social Share Images 🎬

**Released:** January 30, 2026

## Summary

Dynamic social share images for talk pages. When sharing a talk URL on social platforms, the preview now shows a rich branded image featuring the talk thumbnail, mapped tarot card, and curatorial rationale.

## Features

### Layout Design
- **Large Talk Thumbnail**: 700x394 prominent display spanning left side
- **Card Overlay**: Tarot card (190x375) overlays bottom-right corner of thumbnail
  - Drop shadow for depth and visual separation
- **Title & Speaker**: Aligned at top right, matching thumbnail top edge
- **Rationale Quote**: Full text (no truncation) positioned right of card
  - Purple accent border for visual distinction
- **Brand**: TarotTALKS logo in top-left corner
- **Metadata**: Year and duration displayed below thumbnail

### OpenDyslexic Font
- Custom font loaded for all text elements
- Improves readability and accessibility
- Graceful fallback to system fonts if loading fails

### Dynamic Starfields
- Time-seeded sparkle pattern using `Date.now()`
- Unique starfield on every image load
- 12-15 stars with varied sizes and opacity

### Edge Case Handling
- Missing thumbnail: Gradient placeholder with "TED Talk" text
- No mapped cards: Card overlay section hidden
- Missing rationale: Rationale section hidden
- Talk not found: Fallback error message

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `app/talks/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` - OpenGraph image generation
- `app/talks/[slug]/twitter-image.tsx` - Twitter/X and Bluesky images

### Files Added

### Image Dimensions
- Output: 1200x630 (standard OG image size)
- Thumbnail: 700x394

### Key Positions
- Card: `left: 580, top: 220` (overlays bottom-right of thumbnail)
- Rationale: `left: 790, top: 280` (right of card)
- Title section: `paddingTop: 44` (aligned with thumbnail top)
