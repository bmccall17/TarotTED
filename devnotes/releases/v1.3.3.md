# v1.3.3 - Branded Social Card Images 🎴

**Released:** January 29, 2026

## Summary

Dynamic branded OG images for all 78 tarot cards. When sharing card links on Twitter, Bluesky, Facebook, or other social platforms, users now see a beautifully designed 1200×630 horizontal image instead of the awkwardly cropped vertical card.

## Features

### Branded Card OG Images
- **Dynamic generation**: Each card page automatically generates a branded social sharing image
- **Layout**: Card image on right, branding + name + summary + keywords on left
- **Background**: Purple/indigo starfield gradient with scattered sparkle effects
- **Size**: 1200×630 pixels (Twitter/OG recommended dimensions)

### Design Elements
- TarotTALKS branding (top left)
- Card name in large uppercase text
- Card summary (truncated to 120 chars)
- Up to 4 keyword pills with indigo styling
- Full card artwork displayed without cropping
- Cosmic starfield background with glowing sparkles

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
- `app/cards/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` - Dynamic OG image generator for OpenGraph/Facebook/Bluesky
- `app/cards/[slug]/twitter-image.tsx` - Dynamic image for Twitter/X

### Files Modified
- `app/cards/[slug]/page.tsx` - Updated metadata to use dynamic images instead of static card URLs

### Key Details
- Uses Next.js `ImageResponse` from `next/og`
- Node.js runtime (postgres driver not edge-compatible)
- Fetches card data from database at request time
- External card images loaded from Supabase Storage

## Before & After

**Before**: Vertical 400×560 card images displayed poorly on social feeds (cropped or tiny thumbnails)

**After**: Horizontal 1200×630 branded images with:
- Full card artwork visible
- App branding for recognition
- Card name and summary for context
- Keyword pills showing card themes

## Testing

1. Share any card URL on Twitter → branded horizontal image appears
2. Share any card URL on Bluesky → same branded image appears
3. Direct image URLs: `/cards/{slug}/opengraph-image`

## Notes

- Images are generated on-demand (not pre-built)
- Automatically updates when card data changes in database
- No additional storage costs (generated at runtime)
