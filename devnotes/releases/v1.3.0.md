### 🚫 Intentionally NOT Changed

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| localStorage keys (`tarotted-*`) | Backwards compatibility - changing would lose user preferences |
| Migration log file paths | Technical terminal output, not brand references |
| RitualCard "TED Talk" label | Refers to TED content type, not our brand |
