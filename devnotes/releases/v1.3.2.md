## v1.3.2 - Security Patch: React Server Components
**Release Date:** January 12, 2026
**Status:** Production Ready

### Overview

Critical security patch addressing React Server Components vulnerabilities (DoS and source code exposure). This is a dependency-only update with no code changes.

### Security Fixes

#### **CVE-2025-55184 - Denial of Service (High Severity)**
- CVSS Score: 7.5
- Attack vector: Malicious HTTP request to Server Functions endpoint causes infinite loop
- Impact: Service unavailability and server performance degradation

#### **CVE-2025-55183 - Source Code Exposure (Medium Severity)**
- CVSS Score: 5.3
- Attack vector: Malicious HTTP request returns source code of Server Functions
- Impact: Exposure of hardcoded secrets in source code (runtime env vars like `process.env.SECRET` are safe)

#### **CVE-2025-67779 - DoS Bypass (High Severity)**
- CVSS Score: 7.5
- Incomplete fix bypass for CVE-2025-55184
- Required second patch after initial fix was found insufficient

### Technical Notes

- This project uses React Server Actions in `app/admin/login/page.tsx`
- The server action uses `process.env.ADMIN_TOKEN` (runtime env var) which was NOT exposed by CVE-2025-55183
- No hardcoded secrets were at risk, but the DoS vulnerability could have caused service disruption
