Absolutely. Here’s the **concept upgrade**: turn every daily post into a **“speaker-summoning social object”**—where the *link preview* does most of the storytelling, and the text simply invites people in.

This fits TarotTALKS’ core premise (Tarot archetype ↔ TED/TEDx talk) and makes the sharing feel like a *little artifact*, not just a link.

## concept summary

### Two additions to your daily engine

1. **Speaker tagging as a first-class ritual**

* Every talk pairing has a “tag pack” you can drop into posts: speaker handle(s), TED/TEDx brand handles (when appropriate), and optionally the event/org handle.

2. **A platform-native share image that “sells the click”**

* When someone shares a TarotTALKS link on X or Bluesky, the preview image should show:

  * **The Tarot card as the hero**
  * **Talk title**
  * **Speaker name(s)**
  * A clean “TarotTALKS” mark + “TED/TEDx pairing”
* So even if your post text is tiny, the *preview* carries the story.

You already have momentum in this direction (you’ve shipped “Social Sharing” and “Dynamic OG Images” before), so this is an evolution, not a rewrite.

## Speaker tagging strategy (simple + respectful)

### The “Tag Pack” idea

For each talk, you maintain a small set of social tags:

* **Speaker(s):**

  * X handle(s) (if they have them)
  * Bluesky handle(s) (if they have them)
* **Org handles (optional):**

  * TED / TEDx accounts (platform-dependent)
  * The specific TEDx event account (if relevant)

### Rules of thumb (so it stays classy)

* **Tag speakers only when the post genuinely highlights *their idea*** (which yours does).
* If a speaker doesn’t have an account, **don’t force it**—use the plain name.
* If multiple speakers, tag **1–2 max** in the main post; put the rest in a reply (or skip).
* Use **very few hashtags** (or none). The share image + tags do the work.

### Why this works

* Tagging increases the chance of re-shares.
* It makes TarotTALKS feel like it’s in conversation with the TED ecosystem (which is aligned with the project’s soul).

## Social share image concept (card-dominant + talk metadata)

Think of the preview image as a **collectible “TarotTalk Card”**.

### Layout concept (visual hierarchy)

1. **70% Tarot card** (dominant, centered or slightly left)
2. **Talk info panel** (clean, high contrast):

   * Talk title (big, 1–2 lines)
   * Speaker name(s) (clear, readable)
   * TED or TEDx label (small)
3. **TarotTALKS mark** (subtle, consistent, bottom corner)
4. Optional tiny line: **“Flip the card → watch the talk”** or similar

### Make it platform-friendly

* Design so it still reads when cropped.
* Assume people will see it small in-feed.
* Keep typography bold and minimal.

### Why this matters

On both X and Bluesky, people often share without writing much. Your preview image becomes the *actual post*.

## The daily flow (repeatable, zero technical detail)

### Step 1 — Pick the day’s pairing

* Card-of-the-day (or spread)
* The aligned TED/TEDx talk (already in your dataset) 

### Step 2 — Generate the “Daily Drop”

You output **two things**:

1. **Post text** (short)
2. **Share link** (the TarotTALKS URL for that card/talk)

### Step 3 — Add the Tag Pack

* Paste speaker handle(s) for that platform
* Optional: TED/TEDx org handle

### Step 4 — Post to Bluesky first, then X

* Bluesky tends to reward the “poetic artifact” vibe.
* X tends to reward the “punchy hook + tag + question” vibe.

### Step 5 — Optional reply pattern (boost without spamming)

Reply to your own post with:

* 1 quote from the talk (tiny)
* 1 Tarot symbol detail you noticed
* 1 extra speaker tag if needed

---

## What this unlocks (the fun part)

* Every card page becomes a **shareable “portal”** with its own collectible preview.
* Speakers can easily re-share because the preview already looks great.
* Your daily posting becomes a small ritual: **pull card → post artifact → invite reflection**.

If you want next: I can mock up **3 example “Daily Drops”** (Bluesky + X) using this tagging + preview-first approach, so your team has a crystal-clear target for the experience and tone.
