## backstory
Tarot of TED is a project i began in March 2025 during a profoundly challenging chapter of my life. i have been studying and working with Tarot since 1993, and over the years it has remained one of my most trusted tools for grounding and reflection. in recent years i started simplifying with a daily practice of drawing one card, noticing the symbols or patterns on the card, asking my intuition, maybe reading a book or turning to a podcast to learn more. its really all about noticing how i, me specifically, am impacted by the card and what Tarot is saying to me right now, today!

to navigate that difficult season, i returned to that simple daily practice of drawing one Tarot card but i started adding the practice of watching a TED or TEDx talk that aligned with the archetype of that card. day by day, the pattern grew clearer. the themes in the cards echoed the themes in the talks: constraint, liberation, vulnerability, reinvention, courage, power, healing. i continued mapping these connections intentionally throughout the year and soon i had a full framework linking all 78 cards to talks across the TED ecosystem.

i actually gave a [Pecha Kucha talk about this project here in Asheville](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xJLVWDR0iw) on December 5, 2025! which inspired me to see how this project could become more than a personal healing practice... its a dataset, a map, and could become a shared resource for anyone to explore. using Claude Code as my primary development environment, with support from ChatGPT and NotebookLM, i turned the framework into a small Next.js webapp that hosts all 78 card-and-talk pairings, with room to grow through notes, commentary, and expanded metadata. the first version launched on December 9, 2025.

at its core, Tarot of TED is about the art of noticing, pattern recognition, meaning-making, and learning to see your life through multiple lenses at once: ancient and contemporary, symbolic and scientific, internal and external. it is an experiment in learning through symbols, story, and the unexpected conversations between them, and a reminder that sometimes the things we build to save ourselves become things we can offer to others.
